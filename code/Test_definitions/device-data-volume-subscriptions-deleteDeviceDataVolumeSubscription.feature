# device-data-volume-subscriptions-deleteDeviceDataVolumeSubscription
Feature: Device Data Volume Subscriptions API, v0.2.0-rc.2 - Operation deleteDeviceDataVolumeSubscription

  # Input to be provided by the implementation to the tester
  #
  # If the subscription leverages the 'device' object the following indication must be present:
  #    Implementation indications:
  #      * List of device identifier types which are not supported, such as: phoneNumber, networkAccessIdentifier, ipv4Address, ipv6Address
  #
  # Testing assets:
  #       A sink-url identified as "callbackUrl", which receives notifications
  #       A device object which device data volume is known by the network when connected.
  #       The known device data volume status of the testing device
  #
  # References to OAS spec schemas refer to schemas specified in device-data-volume-subscriptions.yaml

  Background: Common Device Data Volume Subscription setup
    Given an environment at "apiRoot"
    And the resource "/device-data-volume-subscriptions/v0.2rc2/subscriptions"
    And the header "Authorization" is set to a valid access token
    And the header "x-correlator" complies with the schema at "#/components/schemas/XCorrelator"

# Happy path scenarios
##########################

  @device_data_volume_subscriptions_01_delete_subscription_based_on_an_existing_subscription-id
  Scenario: Delete the subscription with subscriptionId equal to "id"
    Given the API consumer has an active subscription with "subscriptionId" equal to "id"
    When the request "deleteDeviceDataVolumeSubscription" is sent
    And the path parameter "subscriptionId" is set to "id"
    Then the response status code is 202 or 204
    And the response header "x-correlator" has same value as the request header "x-correlator"
    And if the response property "$.status" is 204 then response body is not present
    And if the response property "$.status" is 202 then response body complies with the OAS schema at "#/components/schemas/SubscriptionAsync" and the response property "$.id" is equal to "id"

  @device_data_volume_subscriptions_02_subscription_delete_event_validation
  Scenario: Receive notification for subscription-ended event on deletion
    Given a valid subscription for a device exists with "subscriptionId" equal to "id"
    And the subscription property "$.sink" is a valid callback URL
    When the request "deleteDeviceDataVolumeSubscription" is sent
    And the path parameter "subscriptionId" is set to "id"
    And the response status code is 202 or 204
    Then a subscription termination event notification is sent to the callback URL
    And the notification body complies with the OAS schema at "#/components/schemas/EventSubscriptionEnded"
    And the notification property "$.type" is equal to "org.camaraproject.device-data-volume-subscriptions.v0.subscription-ended"
    And the notification property "$.data.subscriptionId" is equal to "id"
    And the notification request property "$.data.terminationReason" is equal to "SUBSCRIPTION_DELETED"
