  title: Device Data Volume Subscriptions
  description: |
    This API enables customers to subscribe to events related to data volume usage thresholds on a device. It supports both request and subscription modes to track remaining data volume.

    # Introduction

    ## Device Data Volume Subscriptions

    API consumers can receive notifications regarding data volume usage thresholds, such as when the remaining data volume reaches 50%, 75%, or 90% of the user's allocated data plan. This is useful for managing data usage and avoiding overage fees.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity capable of network communication, identified via an IP address, phone number, or Network Access Identifier.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes the following capabilities:

    ## Device Data Volume Subscriptions

    These endpoints allow management of subscriptions to data volume usage events. The CAMARA subscription model follows the CloudEvents specification.

    When subscribing, it is mandatory to provide the event `types` related to data volume thresholds you wish to track.

    The following event `types` are managed for this API:
      - `org.camaraproject.device-data-volume-subscriptions.v0.data-50-percent`: Event triggered when 50% of the data plan is consumed.
      - `org.camaraproject.device-data-volume-subscriptions.v0.data-75-percent`: Event triggered when 75% of the data plan is consumed.
      - `org.camaraproject.device-data-volume-subscriptions.v0.data-90-percent`: Event triggered when 90% of the data plan is consumed.
      - `org.camaraproject.device-data-volume-subscriptions.v0.data-exceeded`: Event triggered when the data plan is exceeded.

    Note: Additionally, the event `org.camaraproject.device-data-volume-subscriptions.v0.subscription-ends` is sent when the subscription ends. This notification does not require a dedicated subscription.

    It is used in following cases:
      - the subscription expire time (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the maximum number of subscription events (optionally set by the requester) has been reached
      - the subscription was deleted by the requester
      - the Access Token `sinkCredential` (optionally set by the requester) expiration time has been reached
      - the API server has to stop sending notification prematurely

    ### Notification callback

    This endpoint describes the event notification received on subscription listener side when the event occurred.
    As for subscription, detailed description of the event notification is provided in the CAMARA API design guideline document.

    _**WARNING**: This callback endpoint must be exposed on the consumer side as `POST /{$request.body#/sink}`.
      Developers may provide a callback URL on which notifications regarding device data volume events can be received from the service provider.
      If an event occurs the application will send events to the provided webhook - 'sink'._

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified because the  `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

            NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.
            NOTE2: as for this Commonalities release, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.
