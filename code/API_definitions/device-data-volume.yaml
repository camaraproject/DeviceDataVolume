  title: Device Data Volume
  description: |
    This API offers detailed insights into the customer's data usage status, including available data volume and their current position within the volume allocation.

    #  Introduction

    API consumers are able to retrieve data usage information for a dedicated SIM card, offering estimated remaining data volume categories like <200MiB, <1GiB, <5GiB, and >=5GiB. It also allows subscription to changes in data volume status.

    Additionally, a check operation is provided to determine if the remaining data volume exceeds a user-specified threshold.

    # Relevant terms and definitions

    * **Device**: A device refers to any physical entity that can connect to a network and participate in network communication. At least one identifier for the device (user equipment) out of four options: IPv4 address, IPv6 address, Phone number, or Network Access Identifier assigned by the mobile network operator for the device.

    # API Functionality

    The API exposes two endpoints/operations:

    - The endpoint `POST /retrieve` allows customers to retrieve the remaining device data volume.
    - The endpoint `POST /check` allows customers to check if the remaining data volume is above a certain threshold.

    # Authorization and authentication

    The "Camara Security and Interoperability Profile" provides details of how an API consumer requests an access token. Please refer to Identity and Consent Management (https://github.com/camaraproject/IdentityAndConsentManagement/) for the released version of the profile.

    The specific authorization flows to be used will be agreed upon during the onboarding process, happening between the API consumer and the API provider, taking into account the declared purpose for accessing the API, whilst also being subject to the prevailing legal framework dictated by local legislation.

    In cases where personal data is processed by the API and users can exercise their rights through mechanisms such as opt-in and/or opt-out, the use of three-legged access tokens is mandatory. This ensures that the API remains in compliance with privacy regulations, upholding the principles of transparency and user-centric privacy-by-design.

    # Identifying the device from the access token

    This API requires the API consumer to identify a device as the subject of the API as follows:
    - When the API is invoked using a two-legged access token, the subject will be identified from the optional `device` object, which therefore MUST be provided.
    - When a three-legged access token is used however, this optional identifier MUST NOT be provided, as the subject will be uniquely identified from the access token.

    This approach simplifies API usage for API consumers using a three-legged access token to invoke the API by relying on the information that is associated with the access token and was identified during the authentication process.

    ## Error handling:

    - If the subject cannot be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is not included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 MISSING_IDENTIFIER` error code.

    - If the subject can be identified from the access token and the optional `device` object is also included in the request, then the server will return an error with the `422 UNNECESSARY_IDENTIFIER` error code. This will be the case even if the same device is identified by these two methods, as the server is unable to make this comparison.

    # Additional CAMARA error responses
      The list of error codes in this API specification is not exhaustive. Therefore the API specification may not document some non-mandatory error statuses as indicated in `CAMARA API Design Guide`.
      Please refer to the `CAMARA_common.yaml` of the Commonalities Release associated to this API version for a complete list of error responses. The applicable Commonalities Release can be identified in the `API Readiness Checklist` document associated to this API version.
      As a specific rule, error `501 - NOT_IMPLEMENTED` can be only a possible error response if it is explicitly documented in the API.

    Device:
      description: |
        End-user equipment able to connect to a mobile network. Examples of devices include smartphones or IoT sensors/actuators.
            The developer can choose to provide the below specified device identifiers:
            * `ipv4Address`
            * `ipv6Address`
            * `phoneNumber`
            * `networkAccessIdentifier`
            NOTE1: the network operator might support only a subset of these options. The API invoker can provide multiple identifiers to be compatible across different network operators. In this case the identifiers MUST belong to the same device.
            NOTE2: as for this Commonalities release, we are enforcing that the networkAccessIdentifier is only part of the schema for future-proofing, and CAMARA does not currently allow its use. After the CAMARA meta-release work is concluded and the relevant issues are resolved, its use will need to be explicitly documented in the guidelines.

    NetworkAccessIdentifier:
      description: A public identifier addressing a subscription in a mobile network. In 3GPP terminology, it corresponds to the GPSI formatted with the External Identifier ({Local Identifier}@{Domain Identifier}). Unlike the telephone number, the network access identifier is not subjected to portability ruling in force, and is individually managed by each operator.

    DeviceIpv4Addr:
      type: object
      description: |
        The device should be identified by either the public (observed) IP address and port as seen by the application server, or the private (local) and any public (observed) IP addresses in use by the device (this information can be obtained by various means, for example from some DNS servers).

        If the allocated and observed IP addresses are the same (i.e. NAT is not in use) then  the same address should be specified for both publicAddress and privateAddress.

        If NAT64 is in use, the device should be identified by its publicAddress and publicPort, or separately by its allocated IPv6 address (field ipv6Address of the Device object)

        In all cases, publicAddress must be specified, along with at least one of either privateAddress or publicPort, dependent upon which is known. In general, mobile devices cannot be identified by their public IPv4 address alone.

        publicAddress:
